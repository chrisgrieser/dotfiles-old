# Info
- The `CSS3` Sublime Package has to be symlinked and cannot be installed automatically via listing in Package Control settings, since I modified it manually. (Removing autocompletions to avoid overlap with the `lsp-css` package.)
- `Copy file Name` is a custom package and therefore not registered to Package Control, hence also manually synced.
