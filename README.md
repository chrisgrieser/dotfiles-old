## Configurations of Interest
Most people tell me they find the following configurations most useful:
- [Sublime keybindings](/Sublime%20User%20Folder/Default%20(OSX).sublime-keymap), e.g. for Vintage Mode (Sublime's Vim Emulator)
- [.zshrc setup](/zsh/)
- Pandoc configs & my pointers on [how to use pandoc](/pandoc/#Pandoc)
- [complex modifications for Karabiner Elements](/.config/karabiner)
- [starship prompt](/.config/starship/starship.toml)

## What is this repository?
Essentially, it's all of my dotfiles, that I put online for backup, version history, and easy sharing with others.

__What are "dotfiles"?__
- Read this excellent [primer what dotfiles are](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/dotfiles-what-is-a-dot-file-and-how-to-create-it-in-mac-and-linux/).
- Here is an interesting [report on common contents of dotfiles](https://github.com/Kharacternyk/dotcommon).

__How this repository works__
- These files are symlinked into iCloud for synchronization.
- `crontab` on my main machine [is configured](Cron%20Jobs/30-min.sh) to run the script [30-min.sh](Cron%20Jobs/30-min.sh) every 30 minutes.
- [30-min.sh](Cron%20Jobs/30-min_%5BBrowser-Path%5D.sh) runs various tasks that should run regularly, one of them is to trigger the shell script [git-dotfile-backup.sh](git-dotfile-backup.sh).
- [git-dotfile-backup.sh](git-dotfile-backup.sh) checks whether there have been any changes in dot files. If there are, it creates somewhat useful commit messages and runs the `git add commit pull push` sequence.
- [.gitignore](.gitignore) contains a list of files not to backups for various reasons, e.g. redundancy, privacy, or simply because they are too big for a git repo.

## Got an idea for an improvement?
Feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/chrisgrieser/dotfiles/issues) to suggest an improvement to my settings! :blush:

## About Me
In my day job, I am a sociologist studying the social mechanisms underlying the digital economy. For my PhD project, I investigate the governance of the app economy and how software ecosystems manage the tension between innovation and compatibility.
