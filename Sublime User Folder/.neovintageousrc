" NEOVINTAGEOUS LIMITATIONS
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""
" - Normal `map` (as opposed to noremap) is not supported
" - onoremap seems a little buggy, `onoremap i2 i"` blocks
"   any i command ðŸ™ˆ
" - as opposed to Obsdian, excommands (:help) need to be
"   confirmed with an <CR>
" - "Ã¼" isn't read as character in normal mode https://github.com/NeoVintageous/NeoVintageous/issues/821
" - gi does not work https://github.com/NeoVintageous/NeoVintageous/issues/810

" - Neovintageous does not allow for any insert mode  motifications, these need
"   to be done in Sublime (but without modifier keys (e.g. "HH"), they tend
"   to conflict with Neovintageous bindings

" If you need a custom insert mode key binding you can use the
" "vi_insert_mode_aware" context in your key binding: >
"     {
"         "keys": [...],
"         "command": "...",
"         "context": [{"key": "vi_insert_mode_aware"}]
