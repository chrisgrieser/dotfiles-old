" NEOVINTAGEOUS LIMITATIONS
" - normal `map` (as opposed to noremap) is not supported
" - onoremap seems a little buggy, `onoremap i2 i"` blocks
"   any i command ðŸ™ˆ
" - as opposed to Obsdian, excommands (:help) need to be
"   confirmed with an <CR>
" - Neovintageous does not allow for any insert mode
"   motifications, these need to be done in Sublime
"   (but without modifier keys (e.g. "HH"), they tend
"   to conflict with Neovintageous bindings
