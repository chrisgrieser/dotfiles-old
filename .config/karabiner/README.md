## Capslock to Hyper / Esc
- This rule turns capslock into `‚åò‚å•‚áß‚åÉ`, the so called [Hyper Key](https://holmberg.io/hyper-key/). The Hyper Key can be used as a fifth modifier key.
- If pressed alone, capslock will become `Esc`, which is convenient for vim users.

```

## Vim Utilities
- Modifies `alt + 5/6/8/9/l/n or ^` from the German layout so that it sends `[]{}@~^` the US layout. 
	- This enables the use of those keys for vim, e.g. for `dt]` or `@`, without ever switching keyboard layout. 
	- When sending `~^`, they also stop awaiting another character and for example transforming `^a` into `√¢`, similar to the [One Stroke \`¬¥ Mod](#miscellaneous).
- `Hyper + hjkl` is turned to Arrow Keys for global vim-like navigation (requires Capslock to Hyper Key).
- Scroll up/down globally via `alt+j/k`.
- Press `k` and `l` "simultaneously" to send an `enter`.
- Focus window & hide cursor[^2] by tapping `alt-left`. Useful to focus the frontmost app, after another app's window has been closed, e.g. closing the last finder window; and for vim emulators that cannot properly hide the cursor, like e.g. Vimium.

## Mouse Click Trickery
- Middle click to close an app (`cmd + q`) (except for Finder).
- Tapping the Right Mouse Button in a browser[^3] to open link in background. Press with any modifier key for a normal right click. Is triggered only when briefly tapping so that mouse gestures aren't affected. (This rule essentially emulates the [Right Click Open Link Chrome Extensions](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/right-click-opens-link-ne/mhjkeimpgjokbjmioglhlngefbddppnn) extension.)
- Briefly Holding Mouse Button 4 will search for the selected text (or open the url, if a link is selected), tapping will send `F13` (for app-specific automations).

```

## Shift Utilities
- `shift-backspace` to delete forwards. 
- Tap `right-shift` alone to search the selected text / open the selected URL.

## Fn App-Switcher
`fn + {letter}` launches/switches to a pre-defined app
- `fn + c` ‚Üí `C`alendar ‚Üí BusyCal
- `fn + b` ‚Üí `B`rowser ‚Üí Brave Browser
- `fn + o` ‚Üí `O`bsidian
- `fn + d` ‚Üí `D`iscord
- `fn + s` ‚Üí `S`lack
- `fn + r` ‚Üí `D`rafts
- `fn + f` ‚Üí `F`inder (with a default folder)
- `fn + r` ‚Üí D`r`afts
- `fn + e` ‚Üí `E`ditor ‚Üí Sublime Text
- `fn + y`[^1] ‚Üí `Y`ouTube
- `fn + z`[^1] ‚Üí `Z`oom
- `fn + p` ‚Üí `P`DF Reader ‚Üí Highlights
- `fn + i` ‚Üí `I`noreader
- `fn + m` ‚Üí `M`ail ‚Üí Mimestream
- `fn + g` ‚Üí `G`oogle Docs
- `fn + w` ‚Üí Microsoft `W`ord
- `fn + a` ‚Üí `A`lfred Preferences
- `fn + t` ‚Üí Better`T`ouchTool
- `fn + k` ‚Üí `K`arabiner Elements
- `fn + shift + k` ‚Üí `K`arabiner EventViewer

Since pressing `fn` interferes with the built-in macOS emoji insertion key, it needs to be disabled (`System Preferences ‚Üí Keyboard ‚Üí "Press üåê to" ‚Üí "Do Nothing"`) . 

If you still want to use the `fn` key to open the emoji insertion modal, you can simply activate the second rule which does exactly that when `fn` is pressed alone.

## Miscellaneous
- **One Stroke \`¬¥ (German Layout)**: Simply makes those characters appear directly, without awaiting another character like `a`, in which case it gets (mostly wrongly) turned into `√†√°`. (Note that the way this is done, they aren't received properly by vim anymore.)
	- Although the same also applies for `^~`, they are not implemented here, since they are solved by the respective [Vim Utilities Mod](#vim-utilities).
- Spacebar Hack (Obsidian/Sublime) transforms `fn + space` to `f19` and `opt + space` to `f18`, to be able to assign them as bindings in a .vimrc.

The keys and apps in the JSON can be edited however wanted.

[^1]: On non-German keyboards, `y` and `z` are switched, so the key codes are the other way round.
[^2]: Technically speaking, moves it slightly above to the bottom right (not complete bottom right to avoid triggering the Dock). 
[^3]: Currently supported: Safari, Brave, Chromium, Vivaldi, and Chrome
